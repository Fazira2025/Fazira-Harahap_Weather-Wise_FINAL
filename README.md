# Zizi-Harahap
Weather Wise Project by Zizi Harahap (22684855) - ISYS5002 Introduction to Programming

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ANOUNCEMENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Here, I provide three starter notebooks. Due to several failed commit submissions, it has been identified that the error originates from the ipywidgets module.
1. Starter Notebook: Contains code using the CLI (Command Line Interface).
2. Starter Notebook (Widgets): Contains code using ipywidgets.
3. Starter Notebook: Similar to option 1 but adapted to use ipywidgets, running in Jupyter Notebook (note: this produces errors when run on Google Colab).

There were several commit errors made to the wrong repositories. Therefore, I have also attached proof of commits made since May 7, 2025, in the form of a Word/PDF document.
