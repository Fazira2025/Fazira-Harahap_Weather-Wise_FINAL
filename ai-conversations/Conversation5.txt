****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT GET_WEATHER_DATA_ WITH API USING JSON FORMAT****

Me: Hi there, so I have this API link, but in text format. Can I have the API in JSON format? Because I need to copy the data value. Since I notice that with this code, I can only display the figures. This is my code. def get_weather_data(location): try: url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}' response = requests.get(url) response.raise_for_status() print(response.text) except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh: print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}') except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc: print(f'Connection Error: {errc}') except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt: print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}') except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err: print(f'Error: {err}')

AI: Yes! The wttr.in API does support JSON output, which will make it much easier to extract specific weather data values. You can get JSON output by adding the format=j1 parameter to your URL.
Here's how you can modify your function to get and parse JSON data:
import requests
import json

def get_weather_data(location):
    """Get weather data from wttr.in in JSON format"""
    try:
        # Add format=j1 to get JSON response
        url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1'
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # Parse the JSON response
        weather_data = response.json()
        
        # Return the parsed data instead of printing it
        return weather_data
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}')
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f'Connection Error: {errc}')
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f'Error: {err}')
    except json.JSONDecodeError as jerr:
        print(f'JSON Decode Error: {jerr}')
    
    return None

def display_weather(weather_data):
    """Display formatted weather information from the JSON data"""
    if not weather_data:
        print("No weather data available.")
        return
    
    # Extract current weather information
    current = weather_data['current_condition'][0]
    location = weather_data['nearest_area'][0]['areaName'][0]['value']
    country = weather_data['nearest_area'][0]['country'][0]['value']
    
    # Display current weather
    print(f"\nCurrent Weather for {location}, {country}")
    print(f"Temperature: {current['temp_C']}°C ({current['temp_F']}°F)")
    print(f"Feels Like: {current['FeelsLikeC']}°C ({current['FeelsLikeF']}°F)")
    print(f"Weather: {current['weatherDesc'][0]['value']}")
    print(f"Humidity: {current['humidity']}%")
    print(f"Wind: {current['windspeedKmph']} km/h, {current['winddir16Point']}")
    
    # Display forecast for the next few days
    print("\nForecast:")
    for day in weather_data['weather']:
        date = day['date']
        max_temp = day['maxtempC']
        min_temp = day['mintempC']
        weather_desc = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']  # Mid-day forecast
        
        print(f"{date}: {min_temp}°C to {max_temp}°C, {weather_desc}")

def get_current_temperature(weather_data):
    """Extract current temperature in Celsius from weather data"""
    if weather_data and 'current_condition' in weather_data:
        return int(weather_data['current_condition'][0]['temp_C'])
    return None

def get_forecast_temperature(weather_data, day_index=0):
    """Extract forecast temperature for a specific day (0=today, 1=tomorrow, etc.)"""
    if weather_data and 'weather' in weather_data and day_index < len(weather_data['weather']):
        return int(weather_data['weather'][day_index]['maxtempC'])
    return None

def suggest_activities(temperature):
    """Suggest activities based on temperature"""
    if temperature is None:
        return ["Unable to determine temperature for activity suggestions."]
    
    if temperature <= 0:
        return [
            "Indoor ice skating",
            "Visit a museum or art gallery",
            "Enjoy hot cocoa at a local café",
            "Movie marathon at home"
        ]
    elif 1 <= temperature <= 10:
        return [
            "Hiking (dress warmly)",
            "Visit a local brewery", 
            "Shopping at indoor malls",
            "Winter photography"
        ]
    elif 11 <= temperature <= 20:
        return [
            "Cycling or mountain biking",
            "Picnic in the park",
            "Outdoor sightseeing",
            "Zoo or botanical garden visit"
        ]
    elif 21 <= temperature <= 30:
        return [
            "Beach visit or swimming",
            "Water sports (kayaking, paddle boarding)",
            "Outdoor dining",
            "Visit local farmers' markets"
        ]
    else:  # temperature > 30
        return [
            "Swimming or water parks",
            "Indoor activities with air conditioning",
            "Visit a shopping mall", 
            "Early morning or evening walks"
        ]
Now you can use these functions in your main menu:
def main():
    location = "London"  # Default location
    weather_data = None
    
    while True:
        print("\n==== WEATHER WISE APP ====")
        print('Please enter your choice (1 - 4):')
        print(f'1. Check Current Weather & View Weather Forecast at {location}')
        print(f'2. Activities Suggestions at {location} (Today, Tomorrow, Day After Tomorrow)')
        print('3. Check Other Location ')
        print('4. Exit Program ')
        
        choice = input("Your choice: ")
        
        if choice == '1':
            weather_data = get_weather_data(location)
            display_weather(weather_data)
        elif choice == '2':
            if not weather_data:
                weather_data = get_weather_data(location)
            
            if weather_data:
                print(f"\n--- ACTIVITY SUGGESTIONS FOR {location.upper()} ---")
                
                # Get today's temperature
                today_temp = get_current_temperature(weather_data)
                print(f"\nToday - Temperature: {today_temp}°C")
                activities = suggest_activities(today_temp)
                print("Recommended Activities:")
                for i, activity in enumerate(activities, 1):
                    print(f"  {i}. {activity}")
                
                # Get tomorrow's temperature
                tomorrow_temp = get_forecast_temperature(weather_data, 0)
                print(f"\nTomorrow - Temperature: {tomorrow_temp}°C")
                activities = suggest_activities(tomorrow_temp)
                print("Recommended Activities:")
                for i, activity in enumerate(activities, 1):
                    print(f"  {i}. {activity}")
                
                # Get day after tomorrow's temperature
                day_after_temp = get_forecast_temperature(weather_data, 1)
                print(f"\nDay After Tomorrow - Temperature: {day_after_temp}°C")
                activities = suggest_activities(day_after_temp)
                print("Recommended Activities:")
                for i, activity in enumerate(activities, 1):
                    print(f"  {i}. {activity}")
            else:
                print(f"Failed to get weather data for {location}")
        elif choice == '3':
            location = input("Enter new location: ")
            print(f"Location updated to {location}")
            weather_data = None  # Reset weather data for new location
        elif choice == '4':
            print("Thank you for using Weather Wise App. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

This approach:

Gets weather data in JSON format which is much easier to work with
Extracts temperatures and other data directly from the structured JSON
Provides functions to display weather and suggest activities
Reuses weather data when possible to avoid unnecessary API calls

With this JSON-based approach, you'll be able to easily access specific weather values like temperature, conditions, humidity, etc., making your activity suggestions more accurate and your code more maintainable.


ME : HI cloud, i've some code to get API from wttr.in. Is this code good or you have another solution?
	def get_weather_data(location):
    try:
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}"
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)  # 10-second timeout
        response.raise_for_status()
        if not response.text.strip():
            print("⚠️ The weather service returned an empty response. Please try again later.")
            return None
        return response.text
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f"HTTP Error: {errh}")
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f"Connection Error: {errc}")
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f"Timeout Error: {errt}")
    except requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects as errr:
        print(f"Redirect Error: {errr}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f"Unknown Error: {err}")
    return None

AI : Your code looks good overall! It has proper error handling with specific exceptions and a timeout setting, which are excellent practices when working with external APIs.
I can suggest a few improvements to make it even better:
- Added proper documentation with docstrings
- Added support for different output formats (text/json/png)
- Added customizable parameters through a params dictionary
- Added handling for JSON parsing errors


ME: I'm confused. I already have the API for text, now you suggest the API in JSON format, but I just have function to get API link. Can you combine it?

AI: I understand your confusion. You want to keep your existing text-based API function while also having the ability to get the JSON data when needed. Let's create a solution that gives you both options:
import requests
import json

def get_weather_data(location, format_type="text"):
    """
    Get weather data from wttr.in
    
    Parameters:
    - location: The location to get weather for
    - format_type: 'text' for ASCII art or 'json' for JSON data
    
    Returns:
    - For text format: None (prints directly)
    - For JSON format: The parsed JSON data
    """
    try:
        # Set URL based on format type
        if format_type.lower() == "json":
            url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1'
        else:  # default to text
            url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}'
            
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        if format_type.lower() == "json":
            # Parse and return the JSON response
            return response.json()
        else:
            # Print the text response as you were doing before
            print(response.text)
            return None
            
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}')
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f'Connection Error: {errc}')
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f'Error: {err}')
    except json.JSONDecodeError as jerr:
        if format_type.lower() == "json":
            print(f'JSON Decode Error: {jerr}')
    
    return None

Now you can use this function in two ways:
1.	For text display (just like your original function):
get_weather_data("London")  # Prints ASCII art weather
2.	For getting JSON data to use in your code:
weather_data = get_weather_data("London", format_type="json")
This approach:
1.	Keeps your original functionality intact - option 1 displays the ASCII art weather just like before
2.	Adds new functionality using JSON data to suggest activities in option 2
3.	Uses a single, flexible function that can handle both formats
4.	Maintains all your error handling
Does this combined approach work better for your needs?


ME: Thankyou, I did it. I want to ask, if I want to display API text, do I have to change something in this function?
if choice == "1": get_weather_data(location)

AI: Your function is perfect as it is! When you call get_weather_data(location) without specifying a format type, it defaults to "text" format, which is exactly what you want for displaying the ASCII art weather.
Let's double-check the relevant parts of the function to confirm:
def get_weather_data(location, format_type="text"):
    # ...
    if format_type.lower() == "json":
        url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1'
    else:  # default to text
        url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}'
    
    # ...
    if format_type.lower() == "json":
        # Parse and return the JSON response
        return response.json()
    else:
        # Print the text response as you were doing before
        print(response.text)
        return None
    # ...
So when you call:
if choice == "1":
    get_weather_data(location)
Since you're not specifying a format_type parameter, it uses the default value of "text". This means it will:
1.	Use the URL without the ?format=j1 parameter
2.	Print the response text directly (the ASCII art weather)
3.	Return None
This is exactly what you want for option 1 - it matches your original function's behavior.
For option 2, you're explicitly calling it with format_type="json":
weather_data = get_weather_data(location, format_type="json")
This way, you get the structured JSON data to work with for activity suggestions.
So you don't need to change anything - your code is working exactly as intended! The function handles both cases perfectly.


ME: Okaay... now can you please teach me how to extract JSON from function get_weather_data to this function create_temperature_visualisation, because I need to display temperature and the weather with visualisation.
Sorry, I only want to display this information: Minimal Temperature Maximal Temperature Average Temperature Date Weather (raining, sunny)
I don't need it to be a graphic visualization.

Absolutely! Let's create a simpler function that just displays the key information you specified: minimum temperature, maximum temperature, average temperature, date, and weather condition. This will be a straightforward text display without any graphics:
def display_temperature_info(location):
    """
    Display key temperature information for a location:
    - Minimum Temperature
    - Maximum Temperature 
    - Average Temperature
    - Date
    - Weather Condition
    """
    # Get the weather data in JSON format
    weather_data = get_weather_data(location, format_type="json")
    
    if not weather_data:
        print("Unable to get weather data")
        return
    
    print(f"\n===== TEMPERATURE INFORMATION FOR {location.upper()} =====")
    
    # Get current date
    from datetime import datetime
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
    
    # Current weather information
    current = weather_data['current_condition'][0]
    current_temp = int(current['temp_C'])
    current_weather = current['weatherDesc'][0]['value']
    
    # Today's forecast information
    today_forecast = weather_data['weather'][0]
    min_temp = int(today_forecast['mintempC'])
    max_temp = int(today_forecast['maxtempC'])
    
    # Calculate average temperature (simple average of min and max)
    avg_temp = (min_temp + max_temp) / 2
    
    # Display information
    print(f"\nDate: {current_date}")
    print(f"Current Weather: {current_weather}")
    print(f"Current Temperature: {current_temp}°C")
    print(f"Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C")
    print(f"Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C")
    print(f"Average Temperature: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")
    
    print("\n=== FORECAST FOR NEXT 3 DAYS ===")
    
    # Show forecast for next few days
    for i, day in enumerate(weather_data['weather']):
        if i == 0:  # Skip today as we already showed it
            continue
        
        date_str = day['date']
        date_obj = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d")
        formatted_date = date_obj.strftime("%A, %d %B")
        
        min_temp = int(day['mintempC'])
        max_temp = int(day['maxtempC'])
        avg_temp = (min_temp + max_temp) / 2
        weather_desc = day['hourly'][4]['weatherDesc'][0]['value']  # Mid-day weather
        
        print(f"\nDate: {formatted_date}")
        print(f"Weather: {weather_desc}")
        print(f"Minimum Temperature: {min_temp}°C")
        print(f"Maximum Temperature: {max_temp}°C")
        print(f"Average Temperature: {avg_temp:.1f}°C")
    
    print("\n" + "=" * 50)

You can add this to your menu system:
def main():
    location = "London"  # Default location
    
    while True:
        print("\n==== WEATHER WISE APP ====")
        print('Please enter your choice (1 - 5):')
        print(f'1. Check Current Weather & View Weather Forecast at {location}')
        print(f'2. Activities Suggestions at {location} (Today, Tomorrow, Day After Tomorrow)')
        print(f'3. Temperature Information for {location}')
        print(f'4. Check Other Location ')
        print(f'5. Exit Program ')
        
        choice = input("Your choice: ")
        
        if choice == '1':
            get_weather_data(location)
        elif choice == '2':
            show_activities_for_location(location)
        elif choice == '3':
            display_temperature_info(location)
        elif choice == '4':
            location = input("Enter new location: ")
            print(f"Location updated to {location}")
        elif choice == '5':
            print("Thank you for using Weather Wise App. Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

This function:
1.	Gets the weather data in JSON format
2.	Extracts and displays the current date, weather condition, and temperature
3.	Shows the minimum, maximum, and average temperatures for today
4.	Shows the same information for the next few days in the forecast
The output is clean, text-based, and includes all the specific information you requested without any graphical elements. It's simple but provides all the essential temperature and weather condition data in an easy-to-read format.


ME : added proper documentation with docstrings, what is it?
AI : Great question! Docstrings are special documentation strings in Python that describe what a function, class, or module does. They're enclosed in triple quotes (""") and are placed right after the function definition, before any code. 
To use your function with the docstring, you can now run: help(get_weather_data)
"""

    Args:
        location (str): City name or location

AI : I see the issue! You need to modify your function to handle both plaintext and JSON formats. Here's how you can update your code:

Partial Code :
