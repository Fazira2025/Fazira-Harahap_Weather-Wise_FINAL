****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT MENU USING PRINT() FUNCTION****

ME: Hi there. So, actually, I have to make a weatherwise assignment through programming - coding. Now I want to make a menu in the main functions. I have gathered an example here, but can you please make it simple and understandable? def display_menu(): print("Weatherwise Assignment Menu") print("1. Check current weather") print("2. View weather forecast") print("3. Exit") def main(): while True: display_menu() choice = input("Please enter your choice (1-3): ") if choice == '1': print("You chose to check the current weather.") # You can add your weather-checking code here elif choice == '2': print("You chose to view the weather forecast.") # Add your forecast code here elif choice == '3': print("Exiting the program.") break else: print("Invalid choice, please try again.") if __name__ == "__main__": main()

AI: 
Here's a simplified version of your code with some minor improvements for readability:
Python
def display_menu():
    print("\nWeatherwise Assignment Menu")
    print("1. Current Weather")
    print("2. Weather Forecast")
    print("3. Exit")

def get_user_choice():
    while True:
        choice = input("Enter your choice (1-3): ")
        if choice in ['1', '2', '3']:
            return choice
        print("Invalid choice, try again.")

def main():
    while True:
        display_menu()
        choice = get_user_choice()

        if choice == '1':
            print("Checking current weather...")
            # Add current weather code here
        elif choice == '2':
            print("Viewing weather forecast...")
            # Add forecast code here
        elif choice == '3':
            print("Exiting program.")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
I made the following changes:
•	Extracted the user input logic into a separate function get_user_choice() to make the code more modular.
•	Added a newline character (\n) before the menu title to separate it from any previous output.
•	Removed unnecessary comments and shortened the menu options.
•	Used a more concise way to check for valid user input in get_user_choice().
You can now add your weather-checking and forecast code where indicated.


ME: Hey, I have made it simpler. How's this? def main(): print('Your Choice (1 - 4) : ') print(f'1. Choice 1') print(f'2. Choice 2') print(f'3. Choice 3') print(f'4. Choice 4') if choice == "1": print('Choice 1') elif choice == "2": print('Choice 2') elif choice == "3": print('Choice 3') elif choice == "4": print('Choice 4') if __name__ == "__main__": main()

AI: 
Your code is simpler, but there are a couple of issues:
•	You're printing the menu options, but you're not actually getting the user's choice. You need to add choice = input() to get the user's input.
•	You're missing an else clause to handle invalid choices.
Here's an updated version of your code:
Python
def main():
    print('Your Menu:')
    print('1. Choice 1')
    print('2. Choice 2')
    print('3. Choice 3')
    print('4. Choice 4')

    choice = input('Enter your choice (1-4): ')

    if choice == "1":
        print('You chose Choice 1')
    elif choice == "2":
        print('You chose Choice 2')
    elif choice == "3":
        print('You chose Choice 3')
    elif choice == "4":
        print('You chose Choice 4')
    else:
        print('Invalid choice')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
If you want the menu to repeat until the user decides to exit, you can add a while loop:
Python
def main():
    while True:
        print('\nYour Menu:')
        print('1. Choice 1')
        print('2. Choice 2')
        print('3. Choice 3')
        print('4. Exit')

        choice = input('Enter your choice (1-4): ')

        if choice == "1":
            print('You chose Choice 1')
        elif choice == "2":
            print('You chose Choice 2')
        elif choice == "3":
            print('You chose Choice 3')
        elif choice == "4":
            print('Exiting...')
            break
        else:
            print('Invalid choice')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


ME: I want to add an emoticon to the menu. How do I do it in Python?
AI: You can add an emoticon to your menu in Python by simply including it in your print statement. Here's an example:
Python
def main():
    while True:
        print('\nYour Menu 😊:')
        print('1. Choice 1 🌞')
        print('2. Choice 2 🌈')
        print('3. Choice 3 🤔')
        print('4. Exit 👋')

        choice = input('Enter your choice (1-4): ')

        if choice == "1":
            print('You chose Choice 1')
        elif choice == "2":
            print('You chose Choice 2')
        elif choice == "3":
            print('You chose Choice 3')
        elif choice == "4":
            print('Exiting... 👋')
            break
        else:
            print('Invalid choice 😕')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

print("Hello, this is the first part of the sentence.\nAnd this is the second part.")


ME: How to make this function print('Invalid choice. Please type 1-4 as a number') bold and italic?

AI: You can use ANSI escape codes to print text in bold and italic. Here's how you can do it:
Python
print("\033[1;3mInvalid choice. Please type 1-4 as a number\033[0m")
Here's what the codes mean:
•	\033[ is the escape sequence
•	1 means bold
•	3 means italic
•	m is the end of the escape sequence
•	\033[0m resets the text to normal
Note that this will only work in terminals that support ANSI escape codes.


ME: 7.	Me: Hi, I have this function. But I just want the Title "weather wise" that has blue color, not the = sign. Can you please make the functions? if __name__ == "__main__": title = "Weather Wise" blue_bold = "\033[1;94m" # 1 for bold, 94 for light blue color = "\033[0m" print("=" * 53) print(blue_bold + title.center(53, "=") + color) print("=" * 53) main()

AI: You can achieve this by printing the "=" signs separately from the title. Here's how you can do it:
Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    title = "Weather Wise"
    blue_bold = "\033[1;94m"  # 1 for bold, 94 for light blue
    color = "\033[0m"

    print("=" * 53)
    print("=" + blue_bold + title.center(51) + color + "=")
    print("=" * 53)

    main()

****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT PARSING GET_WEATHER_DATA FUNCTION****

Me : hi meta, after I did some more experimentation, I have decided to use wttr.in in making this program. And now I am making the get_weather_data() function, I get input like this: 
def get_weather_data(location):
    try:
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}"  # You can add ?format=3 for one-line summary
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text  # Return the ASCII weather text
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"❌ Error fetching weather data: {e}"

From my analysis of the code above, there is only 1 error handling, is that correct or is there another error handling that can be embedded?

AI : The code you've written already includes robust error handling for requests-related exceptions. The requests.exceptions.RequestException is a base class for all exceptions that can occur while making a request, including:

    requests.exceptions.HTTPError: raised when the server returns an HTTP error code (4xx or 5xx)
    requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: raised when there's a network problem (e.g., DNS resolution, refused connection)
    requests.exceptions.Timeout: raised when the request times out
    requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects: raised when the request exceeds the configured number of maximum redirections

Me : i Got it, after i revised I've this code, please make it more powerfull : 
def get_weather_data(location):
    try:
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}"
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)  # 10-second timeout for safety
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError for bad status codes

        # Check if response body is empty
        if not response.text.strip():
            return "⚠️ The weather service returned an empty response. Please try again later."

        return response.text  # Return ASCII-style forecast
    
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        return f"❌ HTTP Error: {e} — Server returned an error code."
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as e:
        return f"❌ Connection Error: {e} — Please check your internet connection."
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e:
        return f"❌ Timeout Error: {e} — The request took too long to complete."
    except requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects as e:
        return f"❌ Redirect Error: {e} — Too many redirects from the server."
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"❌ Unknown Error: {e} — Something unexpected happened."
AI : Your code is already quite robust and handles various potential exceptions that can occur during the request. However, I'll suggest a few minor improvements to make it even more powerful. 
	- Removed redundant error messages: In the except blocks for specific exceptions like ConnectionError, Timeout, and 
	  TooManyRedirects, I've removed the {e} 
    	- Kept the generic RequestException block: This ensures that any unexpected request-related errors are caught and 
	  handled, providing a fallback error message.


ME: I got this code from the professor. A Weather Data Functions. Can you tell me what's the use of this function? def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5): """ Retrieve weather data for a specified location. Args: location (str): City or location name forecast_days (int): Number of days to forecast (1-5) Returns: dict: Weather data including current conditions and forecast """ pass

AI: This function, get_weather_data, is designed to fetch weather information for a given location. It takes two parameters:
1.	location: The city or location name for which you want to retrieve the weather data.
2.	forecast_days: The number of days you want to forecast the weather for, with a default of 5 days if not specified.
The function is expected to return a dictionary containing the current weather conditions and the forecast for the specified number of days. However, the actual implementation is missing, as indicated by the pass statement.
To use this function, you'd call it with a location and optionally specify the number of forecast days, like this:
weather_info = get_weather_data("Sydney", forecast_days=3)

ME: 2.	Me: Hey, can you please make a function get_weather_data with this code included? try: # Update this line to fetch the main display from wttr.in response = requests.get('https://wttr.in/') response.raise_for_status() # This will raise an error for invalid status codes print(response.text) # Print the weather info from the main display except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh: print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}') except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc: print(f'Connection Error: {errc}') except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt: print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}') except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err: print(f'Error: {err}')

AI: Here's the code wrapped in a get_weather_data function:
import requests
def get_weather_data(location=None):
    try:
        if location:
            url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}'
        else:
            url = 'https://wttr.in/'
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print(response.text)
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}')
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f'Connection Error: {errc}')
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f'Error: {err}')

# Get weather data for a specific location
get_weather_data("Sydney")

# Get default weather data
get_weather_data()
In this code:
•	If you pass a location to the get_weather_data function, it will fetch the weather data for that location.
•	If you don't pass a location, it will fetch the default weather data from wttr.in.


ME: Please make it default without the location
AI: 
Here's the code with the default weather data from wttr.in:
Python
import requests

def get_weather_data():
    try:
        url = 'https://wttr.in/'
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print(response.text)
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}')
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f'Connection Error: {errc}')
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f'Error: {err}')

get_weather_data()


ME: please guide me, how to put a dynamic location based on what the users input to the def get_weather_data () function?

 To make the location dynamic based on user input, you can modify the get_weather_data() function to accept a location parameter and then ask for user input before calling the function. Here's how you can do it:
def get_weather_data(location):
    try:
        url = f'https://wttr.in/{location}'
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print(response.text)
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f'HTTP Error: {errh}')
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f'Connection Error: {errc}')
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f'Timeout Error: {errt}')
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f'Error: {err}')

if choice == "1":
    location = input("Enter the location (city name): ")
    get_weather_data(location)
In this code:
•	The get_weather_data() function now takes a location parameter.
•	Before calling the function, we ask the user to input the location using the input() function.
•	We then pass the user's input to the get_weather_data() function.
This way, the weather data will be fetched for the location specified by the user.
