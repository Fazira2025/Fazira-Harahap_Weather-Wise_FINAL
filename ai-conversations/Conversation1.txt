****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT MAKING WEATHER DASHBOARD STRUCTURE****

Me : Hai, can you help me to create weather project. i need to create a weather dashboard using python with API module. Can you help me explain more this problem clearly to help me understand all requirements?

AI : Key Components and Requirements

   	Weather API : This is a service that provides weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, forecast, etc.).
	Python Module to Call the API : Use Python libraries such as requests to send HTTP requests to the API endpoint.
	Parsing the API Data : Extract useful information from the JSON response (e.g., temperature, weather description, humidity, 				wind speed).
	Dashboard Interface : Display the weather information in an easy-to-read, interactive way.
				A dashboard in Jupyter Notebook using ipywidgets or matplotlib to visualize data.
	User Input : Allow the user to enter a location (city, coordinates, postal code).
	Additional Features (Optional but useful) : Show current weather and forecast (e.g., next 3 days). handle errors when location is invalid or API limits exceeded. Visualize temperature trends or precipitation charts.

Me : Based on the explanation above, regarding the key requirements, let's try to identify the input and output flow for the dashboard
	input
	- I want the user to enter their Name
	- user input location
	- simple chatbot for the user to enter the activity they are going to do
	
	output
	- menu navigation with several options
	- Display the weather forecast results
	- visualization of temperature, weather conditions, air humidity etc.
	- weather forecast for the next few days
	- suggestions from chatbots regarding activities they will do based on the weather in a simple way

Is there anything that needs to be developed and added? Oh yeah, this program will be formed simply, okay?

AI : Great! Your input-output flow is well thought out, especially for a simple weather dashboard with a user-friendly chatbot feature. 
	Suggestions / Additions to Consider
	- Input Validation : Check if the location is valid (handle errors if API can't find the location)
	- Menu Navigation : Should be clear and easy to use, e.g., numbered options or commands
	- Weather Data Handling : For simplicity, limit forecast to maybe next 3 days
	- Chatbot Suggestions Logic : If rain expected, suggest “Maybe better to avoid outdoor activities”
	- Keep UI Minimal : If console-based, use clear print statements and input prompts
	- Exit Option : Always provide a way to exit the program gracefully

	Things You Might Want to Add (Optional)
	- Multiple location support (if user wants to check different places)
	- Save user preferences (e.g., name and location) so they don’t have to enter every time
	- Auto-update feature (refresh weather data after some interval or on request)
	- Help or instructions menu for first-time users

Me: Okay, I understand, now I have created a framework for the dashboard application interaction like this

1. Program starts
2. The program displays the initial display to enter the username and location
3. The user starts the program and enters the Main Menu display
4. There are several main menu displays :
	- The menu displays image visualizations for today's weather and the next few days
	- The menu displays the estimated rainfall and possible rain per hour
	- The chatbot suggestion menu for user activities based on the weather forecast that occurs at the time chosen by the 	  
	  (today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow)
	- Menu to change different locations
	- Menu exits the dashboard application
5. The program runs looping until the user enters the id for the exit menu

Is the program above good enough? and is there any introduction of other related structures above?

AI : Your outlined program structure looks solid and clear for a simple weather dashboard! It covers all essential interaction steps and keeps the flow user-friendly and looped until exit. Here's a bit of feedback :
	1. Input Validation and Error Handling
	2. State Management
	3. Data Caching (Optional but Useful)
	4. Modularization
	5. Menu Navigation UX
	6. Exit Handling

****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT PSEUDOCODE****

Me : Okay, now we understand the program flow. The next step is to create a pseudocode for this weather dashboard? In the assessment that I read, this challenge is part of being modular with separate functions starting from data retrieval, displaying data, chatbot interaction and main menu interaction. I have been given the name of each module and its function, do I need to mention it so that we can make it easier to create each part??

AI : Yes, absolutely! Sharing the names of each module along with their intended functions will make it much easier to create a clear, modular pseudocode. It helps to:
	- Define clear responsibilities for each part
	- Avoid overlapping code and make debugging easier
	- Plan the flow of data and interaction between modules

Me : okey great, I will explain each module that must be in this application:
	1. # Define get_weather_data() function here 
	   def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5):
	2. # Define create_temperature_visualisation() and create_precipitation_visualisation() here
	   def create_temperature_visualisation(weather_data, output_type='display'):
	   def create_precipitation_visualisation(weather_data, output_type='display'):
	3. # Define parse_weather_question() and generate_weather_response() here
	   def parse_weather_question(question):
	4. # Define menu functions using pyinputplus or ipywidgets here
	5. # Tie everything together here
	   def generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_data):
	6. # Include sample input/output for each function

AI:START PROGRAM

FUNCTION get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5)
    // Connect to weather API with given location and forecast_days
    // Fetch JSON weather data from API
    // Return the raw weather data

FUNCTION create_temperature_visualisation(weather_data, output_type='display')
    // Extract temperature data from weather_data
    // Create visualization (e.g., chart) for temperature trends
    // Display or return visualization based on output_type

FUNCTION create_precipitation_visualisation(weather_data, output_type='display')
    // Extract precipitation data from weather_data
    // Create visualization (e.g., chart) for precipitation trends
    // Display or return visualization based on output_type

FUNCTION parse_weather_question(question)
    // Analyze user's question string
    // Identify intent and relevant keywords (e.g., rain, temperature, forecast)
    // Return parsed structure (intent, entities)

FUNCTION generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_data)
    // Use parsed_question to find matching info in weather_data
    // Construct a natural language response based on weather data
    // Return response string

FUNCTION show_main_menu()
    // Display menu options to the user:
    // 1. Show today's and next days' weather visualization
    // 2. Show rainfall estimate and hourly rain chance
    // 3. Chatbot suggestions based on activity and forecast day
    // 4. Change location
    // 5. Exit application
    // Get user choice and return it

FUNCTION handle_user_choice(choice, user_info, weather_data)
    IF choice == 1 THEN
        call create_temperature_visualisation(weather_data)
        call create_precipitation_visualisation(weather_data)
    ELSE IF choice == 2 THEN
        show rainfall estimates from weather_data
    ELSE IF choice == 3 THEN
        ask user for planned activity and forecast day (today, tomorrow, day after)
        parse the question with parse_weather_question()
        generate suggestion with generate_weather_response()
        display suggestion
    ELSE IF choice == 4 THEN
        ask user to enter new location
        update user_info.location
        update weather_data with get_weather_data()
    ELSE IF choice == 5 THEN
        exit program
    ELSE
        display "Invalid choice, please try again."

        IF choice == 5 THEN
            BREAK LOOP

END PROGRAM

Analize : - there's no handling error at all

****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT ERROR HANDLING****

ME : Wow, that's great! Before we start Python, can we add something related to error handling? It is expected that every function 
	has error handling such as: 
	1. Failed to retrieve data due to incorrect network or URL address 
	2. Failed because data in the city does not exist 
	3. Input validation if the user has not entered a location 
	4. Input validation if the user does not enter the correct data (must be letters or numbers)

AI : FUNCTION get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5)
    TRY
        IF location is empty OR invalid format THEN
            RETURN error "Invalid location input"
        CALL weather API with location and forecast_days
        IF API call fails (network issue, bad URL) THEN
            RETURN error "Failed to retrieve data from API"
        IF API response indicates location not found THEN
            RETURN error "Location not found in weather database"
        RETURN weather data
    CATCH any exception
        RETURN error "Unexpected error occurred while fetching data"

FUNCTION create_temperature_visualisation(weather_data, output_type='display')
    TRY
        IF weather_data is empty or invalid THEN
            DISPLAY "No valid weather data available for visualization"
            RETURN
        Extract temperature data
        Create and display or return visualization
    CATCH any exception
        DISPLAY "Error creating temperature visualization"

        Create and display or return visualization
    CATCH any exception
        DISPLAY "Error creating precipitation visualization"

FUNCTION parse_weather_question(question)
    IF question is empty THEN
        RETURN error "Empty question input"
    TRY
        Analyze question and extract intent/entities
        RETURN parsed data
    CATCH any exception
        RETURN error "Error parsing question"

FUNCTION generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_data)
    IF parsed_question indicates error THEN

        Generate natural language response based on parsed_question and weather_data
        RETURN response
    CATCH any exception
        RETURN "Error generating weather response"

FUNCTION show_main_menu()
    DISPLAY menu options
    user_input = GET user input
    IF user_input invalid (not a valid menu option) THEN
        DISPLAY "Invalid menu choice, please try again"
        RETURN None or repeat prompt
    RETURN user_input

FUNCTION handle_user_choice(choice, user_info, weather_data)
    IF choice is None THEN
        RETURN
    TRY
        (Handle choices as before)
    CATCH any exception
        DISPLAY "An unexpected error occurred handling your request"

FUNCTION main()
    DISPLAY "Welcome"
    REPEAT
        ASK user for name
        IF name invalid (empty or non-letter characters) THEN
            DISPLAY "Invalid name, please enter letters only"
        ELSE
            BREAK
    REPEAT
        ASK user for location

    CALL get_weather_data(location)
    IF error returned THEN
        DISPLAY error and ASK to re-enter location or exit

    LOOP program menu and interaction as before with error handling

END PROGRAM

****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT MAKING MAIN MENU****

Me : Let's start moving to python, First I start from creating the main() function which I will fill with the Main Menu and user interaction and using input(). From the pseudocode above, we start from the section:
	-  FUNCTION show_main_menu()
           definition def_main(), and put :
	   	create input name
	   	create input location
	   	create menu options with the if function and input from the options:
	   		1. Check Current Weather & View Weather Forecast
	   		2. Check Current Weather Hourly
	   		3. Activities Suggestions & Weather Prediction assistant
	   		4. Check Other Location
	   		5. Exit Program
	- FUNCTION main()
	  execute def_main()

AI : def main():
    print("Welcome to the Weather Dashboard!\n")

    # Get user's name without validation
    name = input("Please enter your name: ").strip()

    # Get user's location without validation
    location = input("Please enter your location (city name): ").strip()

    print(f"\nHello, {name}! Your location is set to: {location}\n")

    while True:
        print("Main Menu:")
        print("1. Check Current Weather & View Weather Forecast")
        print("2. Check Current Weather Hourly")
        print("3. Activities Suggestions & Weather Prediction Assistant")
        print("4. Check Other Location")
        print("5. Exit Program")

        choice = input("Please select an option (1-5): ").strip()

        if choice == '1':
            print("You selected: Check Current Weather & View Weather Forecast")
            # TODO: Call weather visualization function here
        elif choice == '2':
            print("You selected: Check Current Weather Hourly")
            # TODO: Call hourly weather function here
        elif choice == '3':

****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT PARSING API WTTR IN****

Me : Then we move to the creation of the get_weather_data() function, using the API, there are several options in the context of my assessment, after I tried to see interested in using wttr.in, can you explain what things can I use from the API results? is there a simple visualization that can directly create images? or what formats can be created? assist me

AI : Great choice! The wttr.in weather API is an excellent option for beginners and quick projects — it's easy to use, requires no API key, and provides readable weather data in different formats.
Available Formats
1. plaintext ->  https://wttr.in/<City>
		o ASCII-style forecast in text
2. JSON (structured weather data, best for programming) -> https://wttr.in/<City>?format=j1
	- Current Condition
		o Temperature (temp_C / temp_F)
		o Weather description (weatherDesc)
		o Humidity, Wind, UV index, etc.
	- 3-day Forecast
	 	o Daily maxtempC, mintempC
		o Hourly weather: time, tempC, chanceofrain, cloudcover, etc.
3. PNG (it can return image charts — weather graphs) -https://wttr.in/<City>.png

ME : Nice! After I checked, I am interested in using plaintext for the main menu option number 1. Can we make it.. with the API retrieval flow in the get_weather_data() section based on the location that has been inputted previously, then when the user selects number 1 the results will be displayed.. it is hoped that the results can be in the form of visualization

AI : 
before : 
import requests
def get_weather_data(location):
    try:
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}"  # You can add ?format=3 for one-line summary
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text  # Return the ASCII weather text
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"❌ Error fetching weather data: {e}"

ME:
analyze : after ask meta, i need to give more error handling like 
- requests.exceptions.HTTPError: raised when the server returns an HTTP error code (4xx or 5xx)
- requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: raised when there's a network problem (e.g., DNS resolution, refused connection)
- requests.exceptions.Timeout: raised when the request times out
- requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects: raised when the request exceeds the configured number of maximum redirections

- you might also want to consider adding some additional checks or error handling for other potential issues : Empty response: Although response.raise_for_status() checks for HTTP errors, it's still possible to receive an empty response

after i analyze i need more the exception of error handling like for raised when the server returns an HTTP error code, raised when there's a network problem, raised when the request times out, and raised when the request exceeds the configured number of maximum redirections , also Although response.raise_for_status() checks for HTTP errors, it's still possible to receive an empty response. could you help to add on the code?

AI
After : 
import requests

def get_weather_data(location):
    try:
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}"
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)  # 10-second timeout for safety
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError for bad status codes

        # Check if response body is empty
        if not response.text.strip():
            return "⚠️ The weather service returned an empty response. Please try again later."

        return response.text  # Return ASCII-style forecast
    
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as e:
        return f"❌ HTTP Error: {e} — Server returned an error code."
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as e:
        return f"❌ Connection Error: {e} — Please check your internet connection."
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as e:
        return f"❌ Timeout Error: {e} — The request took too long to complete."
    except requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects as e:
        return f"❌ Redirect Error: {e} — Too many redirects from the server."
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"❌ Unknown Error: {e} — Something unexpected happened."

Exception		Handles
HTTPError		4xx, 5xx status codes from server
ConnectionError		No internet, DNS failure, etc.
Timeout			Server took too long to respond
TooManyRedirects	Misconfigured URLs or endless redirects
RequestException	Any uncaught exceptions (safe fallback)
Empty response check	Server replied with nothing even though it's 200 OK


ME : Thank you for your answer, based on external references there is a slight potential issue in the code above, such as:
Removed redundant error messages: In the except blocks for specific exceptions like ConnectionError, Timeout, and 
TooManyRedirects, removed the {e}. is that good? if good please fix it, if not good please provide another solution ( solution from claude ai)

AI : Sure! Here’s the updated get_weather_data() function modified to print the specific exception messages inside the except blocks (instead of returning user-friendly strings), using your variable names errh, errc, etc.:
import requests

def get_weather_data(location):
    try:
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}"
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)  # 10-second timeout
        response.raise_for_status()

        if not response.text.strip():
            print("⚠️ The weather service returned an empty response. Please try again later.")
            return None

        return response.text

    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as errh:
        print(f"HTTP Error: {errh}")
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError as errc:
        print(f"Connection Error: {errc}")
    except requests.exceptions.Timeout as errt:
        print(f"Timeout Error: {errt}")
    except requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects as errr:
        print(f"Redirect Error: {errr}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print(f"Unknown Error: {err}")

    return None

****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT MENU: CHECK OTHER LOCATION****

ME: that's great! the code has successfully run well.. next we jump to option number 4 which is Check Other Location. I have a desire that users can change locations many times while still in the program before choose exit. Is it possible? please provide further explanation

AI : Absolutely, it’s definitely possible — and your desire to let users change locations multiple times during the session is a great idea for flexibility!
How to Enable Multiple Location Changes in Your Program Flow
- Keep location as a variable that persists during the session
- When the user selects option 4 ("Check Other Location")
- All subsequent menu options that use the location
- Loop continues until user chooses Exit (option 5)

Update partial code : 

location = input("Enter your starting location: ")

while True:
    # Show menu...
    choice = input("Choose option: ")

    if choice == '4':
        location = input("Enter new location: ")
        print(f"Location updated to {location}")
    elif choice == '5':
        break


ME : Its GOOD!! All Works, lets jump in to another step. In option number 2, I want to display Current Weather Hourly data. It seems that it is not available in wttr.in plaintext mode above, should we use JSON model?
Here I want to display the percentage of rain probability and the percentage of air humidity that indicates that it will rain / in the form of water that occurs during the 24 hours today. Before we code, can you tell me more about this?

AI : Great! Yes, for hourly weather details like rain probability and humidity percentages over 24 hours, the plaintext format from wttr.in isn’t detailed enough.
You’ll want to use the JSON format (?format=j1), which provides structured weather data, including hourly forecasts with those specifics. (https://wttr.in/<location>?format=j1)
	- "weather" is a list of days (usually 3 days).
	- Each "weather" day contains an "hourly" list with 8 time blocks (3-hour intervals by default): "time" is in 24-hour 
	  format but in multiples of 300 (e.g., 0, 300, 600 → midnight, 3am, 6am).
	- Each hourly block contains "precipMM", "chanceofrain", "tempC", "tempF", and other useful data.

Analyze : The JSON format gives precise, structured hourly info.
	  Plaintext version doesn’t break down data by hour.

ME : okay, thanks for the explanation, now I can imagine how to make a visualization based on:
	- "precipMM" and "chanceofrain" data
	- data visualisation of a line chart
	- only taken based on the "hourly" list with 8 time blocks (3-hour intervals by default) and current date
please explain whether this can be accommodated with (https://wttr.in/<location>?format=j1), and I will put this function into the module def create_precipitation_visualisation(...): where location is based on what is inputted in the main menu.

AI : Yes, your plan is spot on and fully feasible with the JSON data from https://wttr.in/<location>?format=j1
	How to accommodate your requirements:
	- Call the wttr.in API to get JSON data with ?format=j1.
	- Extract the first day’s "hourly" data: data['weather'][0]['hourly'].
	- Use a line chart (e.g., via matplotlib)
def create_precipitation_visualisation(location):
    data = get_weather_json(location)  # Your helper to get JSON data from wttr.in
    hourly_data = data['weather'][0]['hourly']

    times = []
    precip_mm = []
    chance_of_rain = []

    for block in hourly_data:
        # Convert time like '0', '300', '600' to HH:MM format
        hour = int(block['time']) // 100
        times.append(f"{hour:02d}:00")
        precip_mm.append(float(block['precipMM']))
        chance_of_rain.append(int(block['chanceofrain']))

Analize : - https://wttr.in/<location>?format=j1 not yet declared (error)
	  - Not display visualization


DATE - 13/05/2025
****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT ERROR IN WTTR.IN JASON FORMAT****
ME : hey, it seems like you haven't fully created the python pseudocode data, there are some shortcomings / obstacles: 
	1. I don't have a module to call https://wttr.in/<location>?format=j1, while in my data there is a def get_weather_data(location) module to call the API in plaintext form, can we combine both forms in 1 module? maybe we can use the if function? 
	2. matplotlib with line chart doesn't seem to exist yet, can you provide these 2 solutions?

AI : Great observations! Let's address both points clearly:
	- Combining Plaintext and JSON API calls in get_weather_data(location, format_type='plaintext')
	  o Add a format_type parameter that can be 'plaintext' or 'json'.
partial code :
def get_weather_data(location, format_type='plaintext'):
    try:
        if format_type == 'plaintext':
            url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}"

****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT NLP****
Q : helo the code above works well, next I will design a simple chatbot function using NLP. Where this chatbot will answer related to activities based on the weather that occurs. before starting please explain the requirements so that I can design the flow better.

A : For designing a simple NLP-based chatbot that suggests activities based on the weather, here’s a clear explanation of the requirements,
    Chatbot Function Requirements
	Input from user : The user types in an activity they want to do (e.g., "jogging", "picnic", "cycling", "hiking", etc.).
	Access to weather data : The chatbot needs current or forecast weather data (temperature, precipitation, humidity, chance of rain, etc.) for the requested day/time at 
				 the user’s location.
	Natural Language Processing (NLP) : Can be simple keyword matching or a small rule-based parser since this is a basic chatbot.
	Decision logic : Based on activity type and weather conditions (e.g., chance of rain, temperature, humidity), such as: "Great weather for jogging today!"
	Output	: Return a clear, friendly text response with advice or suggestions related to the user’s activity and the weather conditions.
     Additional Notes
	Start with simple keyword matching for activities and day/time phrases.
	Maintain a dictionary or set of activities and corresponding weather preferences
	For the timing, map "today" → weather[0], "tomorrow" → weather[1], etc.
	Consider fallback messages for unrecognized activities or unclear inputs.
	Keep chatbot responses friendly and concise.

User input: "Can I go jogging tomorrow?"

Parse:
 - activity = "jogging"
 - day = "tomorrow" (index 1)

Get weather data for day 1:
 - chanceofrain = 20%
 - tempC = 25

Check rules:
 - jogging ok if rain chance < 30% and temp between 15-30

Response:
 "Looks good! Tomorrow should be great for jogging. Enjoy!"


ME: Okay, first we will create a function create_temperature_visualisation() which takes data from get_weather_data(location, format_type="json"): about Date, Weather, Minimum Temperature, Maximum Temperature, Average Temperature from the JSON data generated above. then the visualization is in the form of a text display, which is more or less described as follows:

-----------------------------------------------------
                    ACTIVITY
-----------------------------------------------------
Location   : Perth
Date       : Thursday, 22 May 2025
Weather    : Sunny
Temperature: Min 15°C | Max 23°C | Avg 19°C

AI : def create_temperature_visualisation(location):
    data = get_weather_data(location, format_type="json")

    # For demonstration, show info for each day in the forecast
    for day in weather_days:
        date = day.get('date', 'Unknown Date')
        # Format date nicely (optional: convert 'YYYY-MM-DD' to e.g. Thursday, 22 May 2025)
        # Let's do simple parsing using datetime:
        from datetime import datetime
        try:
            dt_obj = datetime.strptime(date, "%Y-%m-%d")
            formatted_date = dt_obj.strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")

Analyze : - display weather description with emoji for more good display
	  - i think we can use the data to make a condition for suggestion activity chatbot

****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT ADDING EMOJIS FOR WEATHER_DESC****
ME: I have some idea to add emoji for weather_desc, could you make function module to handle it?
AI: Absolutely! Adding emojis based on weather descriptions is a great idea to make your output more lively and user-friendly.
	def get_emoji(weather_desc):
    """
    Return an emoji corresponding to the weather description.
    """
    desc = weather_desc.lower()

    if "sun" in desc or "clear" in desc:
        return "☀️"  # Sunny/Clear
    elif "cloud" in desc:
        return "☁️"  # Cloudy
    elif "rain" in desc or "drizzle" in desc:
        return "🌧️"  # Rain
    elif "thunder" in desc or "storm" in desc:
        return "⛈️"  # Thunderstorm
    elif "snow" in desc or "sleet" in desc:
        return "❄️"  # Snow
    elif "fog" in desc or "mist" in desc or "haze" in desc:
        return "🌫️"  # Fog/Mist
    elif "wind" in desc:
        return "🌬️"  # Windy

ME :I want to make a parse question using NLP in my program. Please tell me more about this.
AI: Great! Using NLP (Natural Language Processing) to parse user questions can help your program understand natural language inputs more effectively and respond appropriately.
1. What is parsing in NLP?
	Parsing means breaking down a sentence into meaningful parts to extract key information, such as:
    		Intent: What does the user want? (e.g., asking for weather, requesting activity suggestions)
    		Entities: Important data in the sentence (e.g., location, date/time, activity type)
2. Why use NLP for parsing questions?
	Understand varied ways users can phrase questions.
	Extract structured data from unstructured text input.
	Enable dynamic, conversational interfaces.
3. Basic steps to parse questions in your program:
	Text preprocessing : Lowercase, remove punctuation, tokenize (split into words).
	Entity Recognition : Detect keywords or phrases related to activities, time, and locations. Rule-based regex patterns.


ME: I have the following weather code. Please help create the function   (i give def get_weather_data(location, format_type='plaintext'): and def create_temperature_visualisation(location):)

AI: Certainly! To create the parse_weather_question() function, our goal is to process a user’s weather question by extracting information such as location and date (today, tomorrow, or day after tomorrow). Then, we will use that information to direct the weather request to the function you already made, create_temperature_visualisation().
Here is an example implementation of the parse_weather_question() function:
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_weather_question(question):
    # Define regex patterns to detect location and time
    location_pattern = r"(in|at)\s([a-zA-Z\s]+)"
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|day after tomorrow)"
    
    # Search for location in the question
    location_match = re.search(location_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    
    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    
    # Default location to None and time to "today"
    location = None
    time = "today"
    
    if location_match:
        location = location_match.group(2).strip()
    
    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()

    # Determine target date based on the time mentioned
    target_date = datetime.now()
    
    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "day after tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Display extracted results
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
    
    # Call the function to show weather based on location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

# Example usage
question = "What is the weather in Perth tomorrow?"
parse_weather_question(question)


Explanation:
1.	Location Extraction:
Uses regex to find keywords "in" or "at" followed by a location name. The location is extracted as the word(s) after "in" or "at".
2.	Time Extraction:
Uses regex to find words like "today", "tomorrow", or "day after tomorrow". If no time is mentioned, the default is "today".
3.	Target Date:
Based on the detected time (e.g., "tomorrow"), the target date is calculated accordingly by adding days to the current date.
4.	Calling create_temperature_visualisation(location):
Once location and time are extracted, the function calls your existing weather visualization function, passing the extracted 

ME: Should I replace this part to call the new function?
elif choice == "3": create_temperature_visualisation(location)
AI :Yes, if you want to use the new parse_weather_question() function, you should replace the part that calls create_temperature_visualisation(location) with a call to parse_weather_question(question).
You can replace it with:
elif choice == "2":
    # Get weather question input from the user
    question = input("Enter your weather question: ")
    # Call the function to parse the weather question
    parse_weather_question(question)
    # Panggil fungsi untuk parse pertanyaan cuaca
    parse_weather_question(question)

DATE- 15/05/2025
ME : Why is the location not detected? Here is my code output:
	Enter your weather question:  Running today
	Location: None
	Time: Today
	Target Date: Thursday, 22 May 2025
	Please provide a valid location.

     i already put location here name = input('🤖: Hi! Please enter your name: ')
  	location = input(f'🤖: Which location would you like to check, {name}? ')
AI : Ah, now I understand that the location has already been entered by the user earlier in main(), and you want the 	parse_weather_question() function to directly use that location without requiring location input again.
	Problem:
	Previously, parse_weather_question() tried to find location by regex from the question text, but if the input is 	something like "Perth tomorrow" without keywords like "in" or "at", regex won’t capture the location.
	Solution:
	Modify parse_weather_question() so that:
   def parse_weather_question(question, location):
    # Regex pattern to detect time
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|day after tomorrow)"
    
    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    
    # Default time to "today" if not found
    time = "today"
    
    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()  # Extract time (today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow)

    # Calculate target date based on time
    target_date = datetime.now()
    
    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time == "day after tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Display extracted info
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")
    
    # Call function to show weather based on location and date
    if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location)
    else:
        print("Please provide a valid location.")

****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT ACTIVITY SUGGESTIONS****
ME: From the code. How can I read the activity input by the user? activities such as outdoor (run, swim, sports, tennis, gardening) or indoor (cooking, reading, studying)

AI : Ah, I see! You're referring to activities like outdoor activities (e.g., running, swimming, sports) or indoor activities (e.g., cooking, reading, studying) rather than weather-related activities.
To detect such activities in the user input, you can create a list of activity keywords for both indoor and outdoor activities and then use regular expressions to search for them in the user's question.
Here's how you can modify your code to detect indoor and outdoor activities based on user input:
Modified Code to Detect Activities (Outdoor/Indoor):
import re
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
    # Define regex pattern to detect time
    time_pattern = r"(today|tomorrow|after[-\s]?tomorrow|day[-\s]?after[-\s]?tomorrow)"
    
    # Lists of outdoor and indoor activities
    outdoor_activities = r"(run|swim|sports|tennis|cycling|hiking|jogging|fishing|camping)"
    indoor_activities = r"(cooking|reading|studying|watching movies|baking|painting|knitting|gaming)"
    
    # Search for time in the question
    time_match = re.search(time_pattern, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    # Search for outdoor activity
    outdoor_match = re.search(outdoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)
    # Search for indoor activity
    indoor_match = re.search(indoor_activities, question, re.IGNORECASE)

    # Default time to "today" if not found
    time = "today"
    activity = None  # Default no activity found
    activity_type = None  # Default no activity type found

    if time_match:
        time = time_match.group(1).lower()  # Extract time (today, tomorrow, after-tomorrow)
    
    if outdoor_match:
        activity = outdoor_match.group(1).lower()
        activity_type = "Outdoor"
    elif indoor_match:
        activity = indoor_match.group(1).lower()
        activity_type = "Indoor"

    # Calculate target date based on time
    target_date = datetime.now()

    if time == "tomorrow":
        target_date += timedelta(days=1)
    elif time in ["after-tomorrow", "day after tomorrow"]:
        target_date += timedelta(days=2)

    # Use the previously input location
    location = location_from_input

    # Display extracted information
    print(f"Location: {location}")
    print(f"Time: {time.capitalize()}")
    print(f"Target Date: {target_date.strftime('%A, %d %B %Y')}")

Q : Hey, I just realised that when a user types any time pattern, the program shows the whole time pattern. How to show the visualisation only based on what the time pattern is desired by the user

AI : I see! It looks like your program is showing the weather visualization for the entire time period rather than only for the desired day based on the user's input. To fix this, you'll need to ensure that the weather data is displayed only for the target date (which corresponds to the time input, like "today", "tomorrow", or "after tomorrow").
Solution:
1.	Ensure the Target Date is Properly Calculated:
You are already calculating the target_date based on the user's input (e.g., "today", "tomorrow", or "after tomorrow"). This is great, but you'll need to ensure the weather visualization only corresponds to this date.
2.	Fetch the Weather Data for the Target Date:
Instead of showing the weather data for the next 3 days or for all days, you should adjust your create_temperature_visualisation() function (or its equivalent) to fetch and display the weather only for the calculated target_date.
3.	Modify the Logic to Only Visualize for the Desired Date:
Here's how you can adjust the code to only display the weather for the target_date.

def parse_weather_question(question, location_from_input):
	...
	...
	 if location:
        create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date)

def create_temperature_visualisation(location, target_date):
    .....
    ....
    target_date_str = target_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    print("-" * 53)
    print(f"{'ACTIVITY':^53}")
    print("-" * 53)

    # Find and print only the target day weather
    for day in weather_days:
        if day.get('date') == target_date_str:
            date = day.get('date', 'Unknown Date')
            try:
                dt_obj = datetime.strptime(date, "%Y-%m-%d")
                formatted_date = dt_obj.strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")
            except Exception:
                formatted_date = date

            break  # Exit after printing target date info
    else:
        print(f"No weather data found for {target_date_str}.")

ME: Can I make activities suggestions? How do I integrate with that code?
How do I create a response in Python using a generate_weather_response() function for the output?

AI : Absolutely! You can create activity suggestions based on weather and temperature data, and integrate it nicely with your existing create_temperature_visualisation() function.
	1. Modify create_temperature_visualisation() to return a dict with all data needed:
	....exist code....	 
	for day in weather_days:
        if day.get('date') == target_date_str:
            date = day.get('date', 'Unknown Date')

            except Exception:
                formatted_date = date
                
            weather_desc = day.get('hourly', [{}])[4].get('weatherDesc', [{'value': 'N/A'}])[0]['value']
            mintempC = day.get('mintempC', 'N/A')
            maxtempC = day.get('maxtempC', 'N/A')
            avgtempC = day.get('avgtempC', 'N/A')
            weather_emoji = get_emoji(weather_desc)

            # Return data dictionary instead of printing
            return {
                "location": location.capitalize(),
                "date": formatted_date,
                "weather_desc": weather_desc,
                "weather_emoji": weather_emoji,

            }
    	print(f"No weather data found for {target_date_str}.")
    	return None
	
	2. Create a generate_weather_response() function to build suggestions
	   def generate_weather_response(location, date_str, activity, activity_type, weather_desc, weather_emoji, min_temp, max_temp, avg_temp):
    desc = weather_desc.lower()
    avg_temp = float(avg_temp)

    bad_weather_keywords = ['rain', 'thunder', 'fog', 'mist', 'shower', 'snow', 'drizzle', 'downpour', 'blizzard', 'sleet', 'ice', 'hail', 'flurry']

    bad_weather = any(word in desc for word in bad_weather_keywords)

    if activity_type.lower() == "outdoor":
        if bad_weather or avg_temp < 15:

****EXPLANATIONS ABOUT IPYWIDGETS****
ME : Hi, all code was good, can you help me to explain about ipywidgets?
AI : ipywidgets is a Python library that provides interactive HTML widgets for Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab.
    It allows you to add sliders, buttons, dropdowns, text inputs, checkboxes, and more — all interactive UI controls embedded    
    right inside your notebook.
    
ME : an you explain about ipwidget for programs in the form of a menu list and have input for choices. Oh yes, is it also possible to enter the name and location of the user beforehand?
AI : Hello! Of course you can, let me explain.

IPWidget usually refers to an interactive widget in Jupyter Notebook (IPython Widget), which allows us to create menus, text inputs, buttons, and other interactive elements that can be used directly in the notebook.

If you want to create a program with a menu list + input options, plus initial input for the user's name and location, this is very possible with ipywidgets

ME : import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display, clear_output

name_input = widgets.Text(description='Name:')
location_input = widgets.Text(description='Location:')
submit_button = widgets.Button(description="Submit")
output = widgets.Output()

def show_menu():
    with output:
        clear_output()
        print("Menu Options:")
        print("1. Check Weather")
        print("2. View Activities")
        print("3. Exit")
    choice_input = widgets.Text(description='Enter choice:')
    choose_button = widgets.Button(description='Choose')

    def on_choose_clicked(b):
        with output:
            clear_output()
            choice = choice_input.value.strip()
            print(f"You chose: {choice}")
            if choice == '1':
                print(f"Displaying weather for {location_input.value}...")
            elif choice == '2':
                print("Displaying suitable activities...")
            elif choice == '3':
                print("Thank you!")
            else:
                print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
                show_menu()  # Show the menu again if invalid choice

    show_menu()

submit_button.on_click(on_submit_clicked)

display(name_input, location_input, submit_button, output)


ME : Why is the input for the menu and button options not visible?
AI : Common causes and solutions:

display() must be called in function scope
Make sure display(input_choice, select_button) is called inside the display_menu() function so that the widget appears when the menu is displayed.

Don't clear the output (clear_output()) before display()
If you use clear_output(), make sure to call display() after it so that the new widget appears.

The widget must be called in the same context as the output
Since we are using the Output() widget as a container, if display() is outside the with output: context, the widget sometimes becomes invisible. and add if you have selected 1 and then want to select again, can you add an input button or type exit?

ME : Absolutely! We can add a feature so that after you select a menu, there is an option to:

Select again (re-display menu)

Or type exit to exit
